  </font></b></p>

<p><b>YOUR FIRST C PROGRAM</b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>TRIVIAL.C </b></p>

<p>The best way to get started with C is to actually study a program, so
load the file named TRIVIAL.C and display it on the monitor. You are looking
at the simplest possible C program. There is no way to simplify this program
or to leave anything out. Unfortunately, the program doesn't do anything.
</p>

<p>The word <b>main </b>is very important, and must appear once, and only
once in every C program. This is the point where execution is begun when
the program is run. We will see later that this does not have to be the
first statement in the program but it must exist as the entry point. Following
the <b>main </b>program name is a pair of parentheses which are an indication
to the compiler that this is a function. We will cover exactly what a function
is in due time. For now, I suggest that you simply include the pair of
parentheses. </p>

<p>The two curly brackets in lines 2 and 3, properly called braces, are
used to define the limits of the program itself. The actual program statements
go between the two braces and in this case, there are no statements because
the program does absolutely nothing. You can compile and run this program,
but since it has no executable statements, it does nothing. Keep in mind,
however, that it is a valid C program. When you compile this program, you
may get a warning. You can ignore the warning and we will discuss it later
in this tutorial, or you can modify the program so that it appears as follows;</p>

<pre>    int main()
    {
       return 0;
    }</pre>

<p>This modified program must compile on any good C compiler since it conforms
to the ANSI-C standard. We will explain the difference in these two programs
later in this tutorial.</p>

<p><b>A PROGRAM THAT DOES SOMETHING </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>WRTSOME.C </b></p>

<p>For a much more interesting program, load the program named WRTSOME.C
and display it on your monitor. It is the same as the previous program
except that it has one executable statement between the braces plus the
obligatory <b>return </b>statement. </p>

<p>The executable statement is a call to a function supplied as a part
of your C library. Once again, we will not worry about what a function
is, but only how to use this one named <b>printf()</b>. In order to output
text to the monitor, the desired text is put within the function parentheses
and bounded by quotation marks. The end result is that whatever text is
included between the quotation marks will be displayed on the monitor when
the program is run. </p>

<p>Notice the semi-colon at the end of line 5. C uses a semi-colon as a
statement terminator, so the semi-colon is required as a signal to the
compiler that this line is complete. This program is also executable, so
you can compile and run it to see if it does what you think it should.
It should cause the text between the quotation marks to appear on the monitor
when you execute it. </p>

<p>You can ignore the statements in lines 1 and 7 in this program and similar
statements in each of the remaining programs in this chapter. These will
be fully described later in this tutorial. We will also define why the
word <b>int </b>is used at the begining of line 3. We have a few preliminary
topics to cover before we get to these items.</p>

<p><b>ANOTHER PROGRAM WITH MORE OUTPUT </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>WRTMORE.C </b></p>

<p>Load the program WRTMORE.C and display it on your monitor for an example
with more output and another small but important concept. You will see
that there are four executable statements in this program, each one being
a call to the function <b>printf().</b> The top line will be executed first,
then the next, and so on, until the fourth line is complete. The statements
are executed sequentially from top to bottom. </p>

<p>Notice the funny character near the end of the first line, namely the
backslash. The backslash is used in the <b>printf()</b> statement to indicate
that a special control character is following. In this case, the &quot;<b>n</b>&quot;
indicates that a newline is requested. This is an indication to return
the cursor to the left side of the monitor and move down one line. Any
place within printed text that you desire, you can put a newline character
to start a new line. You could even put it in the middle of a word and
split the word between two lines. </p>

<p>A complete description of this program is now possible. The first <b>printf()</b>
outputs a line of text and returns the carriage. (Of course, there is no
carriage, but the cursor is moved to the next line on the monitor. The
terminology carries over from the days of teletypes.) The second <b>printf()</b>
outputs a line of text but does not return the carriage so that the third
line is appended to the end of the second, then followed by two carriage
returns, resulting in a blank line. Finally the fourth <b>printf()</b>
outputs a line followed by a carriage return and the program is complete.
</p>

<p>After compiling and executing WRTMORE.C, the following text should be
displayed on your monitor; </p>

<pre>This is a line of text to output. 
And this is another line of text.
 
This is a third line. 
</pre>

<p>Compile and execute this program to see if it gives you this output.
It would be a good idea at this time for you to experiment by adding additional
lines of printout to see if you understand how the statements really work.
Add a few carriage returns in the middle of a line to prove to yourself
that it works as stated, then compile and execute the modified program.
The more you modify and compile the example programs included with this
tutorial, the more you will learn as you work your way through it. </p>

<p><b>LET'S PRINT SOME NUMBERS </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>ONEINT.C </b></p>

<p>Load the file named ONEINT.C and display it on the monitor for our first
example of how to work with data in a C program. The entry point <b>main()
</b>should be clear to you by now as well as the beginning brace. The first
new thing we encounter is line 5 containing <tt>int index;</tt> which is
used to define an integer variable named <b>index</b>. The word <b>int
</b>is a keyword in C, and can not be used for anything else. It defines
a variable that can store a whole number within a predefined range of values.
We will define an actual range later. The variable name, <b>index</b>,
can be any name that follows the rules for an identifier and is not one
of the keywords for C. The final character on the line, the semi-colon,
is the statement terminator as discussed earlier. </p>

<p>Note that, even though we have defined a variable, we have not yet assigned
a value to it, so it contains an undefined value. We will see in a later
chapter that additional integers could also be defined on the same line,
but we will not complicate the present situation. </p>

<p>Observing the main body of the program, you will notice that there are
three statements that assign a value to the variable <b>index</b>, but
only one at a time. The statement in line 7 assigns the value of 13 to
<b>index</b>, and its value is printed out by line 8. (We will see how
shortly. Trust me for the time being.) Later, the value of 27 is assigned
to <b>index</b>, and finally 10 is assigned to it, each value being printed
out. It should be intuitively clear that <b>index </b>is indeed a variable
and can store many different values but only one value at a time of course.
</p>

<p>Please note that many times the words &quot;printed out&quot; are used
to mean &quot;displayed on the monitor&quot;. You will find that in many
cases experienced programmers take this liberty, probably due to the <b>printf()</b>
function being used for monitor display. </p>

<p><b>HOW DO WE PRINT NUMBERS? </b></p>

<p>To keep our promise, let's return to the <b>printf()</b> statements
for a definition of how they work. Notice that they are all identical and
that they all begin just like the <b>printf()</b> statements we have seen
before. The first difference occurs when we come to the % character. This
is a special character that signals the output routine to stop copying
characters to the output and do something different, usually to output
the value of a variable. The <b>% </b>sign is used to signal the output
of many different types of variables, but we will restrict ourselves to
only one for this example. The character following the <b>% </b>sign is
a <b>d</b>, which signals the output routine to get a decimal value and
output it. Where the decimal value comes from will be covered shortly.
After the <b>d</b>, we find the familiar <b>\n</b>, which is a signal to
return the video &quot;carriage&quot;, and the closing quotation mark.
</p>

<p>All of the characters between the quotation marks define the pattern
of data to be output by this statement. Following the output pattern, there
is a comma followed by the variable name <b>index</b>. This is where the
<b>printf()</b> statement gets the decimal value which it will output because
of the <b>%d</b> we saw earlier. The system substitutes the current value
of the variable named <b>index </b>for the <b>%d</b> and copies it to the
monitor. We could add more <b>%d</b> output field descriptors anywhere
within the brackets and more variables following the description to cause
more data to be printed with one statement. Keep in mind however, that
the number of field descriptors and the number of variable definitions
must be the same or the runtime system will generate something we are not
expecting. </p>

<p>Much more will be covered at a later time on all aspects of input and
output formatting. A reasonably good grasp of these fundamentals are necessary
in order to understand the following lessons. It is not necessary to understand
everything about output formatting at this time, only a fair understanding
of the basics. </p>

<p>Compile and run ONEINT.C and observe the output. Two programming exercises
at the end of this chapter are based on this program. </p>

<p><b>HOW DO WE ADD COMMENTS IN C? </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>COMMENTS.C </b></p>

<p>Load the file named COMMENTS.C and observe it on your monitor for an
example of how comments can be added to a C program. Comments are added
to make a program more readable to you but represent nonsense to the compiler,
so we must tell the compiler to ignore the comments completely by bracketing
them with special characters. The slash star combination is used in C for
comment delimiters, and are illustrated in the program at hand. Please
note that the program does not illustrate good commenting practice, but
is intended to illustrate where comments can go in a program. It is a very
sloppy looking program. </p>

<p>The slash star combination in line 3 introduces the first comment and
the star slash at the end of that line terminates this comment. Note that
this comment is prior to the beginning of the program illustrating that
a comment can precede the program itself. Good programming practice would
include a comment prior to the program with a short introductory description
of the program. The comment in line 5 is after the main program entry point
and prior to the opening brace for the program code itself. </p>

<p>The third comment starts after the first executable statement in line
7 and continues for four lines. This is perfectly legal because a comment
can continue for as many lines as desired until it is terminated. Note
carefully that if anything were included in the blank spaces to the left
of the three continuation lines of the comment, it would be part of the
comment and would not be compiled, but totally ignored by the compiler.
The last comment, in line 15, is located following the completion of the
program, illustrating that comments can go nearly anywhere in a C program.
</p>

<p>Experiment with this program by adding comments in other places to see
what will happen. Comment out one of the <b>printf()</b> statements by
putting comment delimiters both before and after it and see that it does
not get executed and therefore does not produce a line of printout. </p>

<p>Comments are very important in any programming language because you
will soon forget what you did and why you did it. It will be much easier
to modify or fix a well commented program a year from now than one with
few or no comments. You will very quickly develop your own personal style
of commenting. </p>

<p>Some C compilers will allow you to &quot;nest&quot; comments which can
be very handy if you need to &quot;comment out&quot; a section of code
during debugging. Since nested comments are not a part of the ANSI-C standard,
none will be used in this tutorial. Check the documentation for your compiler
to see if they are permitted with your implementation of C. Even though
they may be allowed, it is a good idea to refrain from their use, since
they are rarely used by experienced C programmers, and using them may make
it difficult to port your code to another compiler if the need should arise.</p>

<p><b>GOOD FORMATTING STYLE </b></p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>GOODFORM.C </b></p>

<p>Load the file GOODFORM.C and observe it on your monitor. It is an example
of a well formatted program. Even though it is very short and therefore
does very little, it is very easy to see at a glance what it does. With
the experience you have already gained in this tutorial, you should be
able to very quickly grasp the meaning of the program in it's entirety.
Your C compiler ignores all extra spaces and all carriage returns giving
you considerable freedom in formatting your program. Indenting and adding
spaces is entirely up to you and is a matter of personal taste. Compile
and run the program to see if it does what you expect it to do. </p>

<p>Example program ------&gt; <b>UGLYFORM.C </b></p>

<p>Now load and display the program UGLYFORM.C and observe it. How long
will it take you to figure out what this program will do? It doesn't matter
to the compiler which format style you use, but it will matter to you when
you try to debug your program. Compile this program and run it. You may
be surprised to find that it is the same program as the last one, except
for the formatting. Don't get too worried about formatting style yet. You
will have plenty of time to develop a style of your own as you learn the
C language. Be observant of styles as you see C programs in magazines and
books. </p>

<p>This covers some of the basic concepts of programming in C, but as there
are many other things to learn, we will forge ahead to additional program
structure. It will definitely be to your advantage to do the programming
exercises at the end of each chapter. They are designed to augment your
studies and teach you to use your compiler. </p>

<p><b>PROGRAMMING EXERCISES </b></p>

<ol>
<li>Write a program to display your name on the monitor.</li>

<li>Modify the program to display your address and phone number on separate
lines by adding two additional <b>printf()</b> statements.</li>

<li>Remove line 7 from ONEINT.C by commenting it out, then compile and
execute the resulting program to see the value of an uninitialized variable.
This can be any value within the allowable range for that variable. If
it happens to have the value of zero, that is only a coincidence, but then
zero is the most probable value to be in an uninitialized variable because
there are lots of zero values floating around in a computer's memory. It
is actually legal for the program to abort if you refer to a variable that
you failed to initialize, but few compilers, if any, will actually do so.</li>

<li>Add the following two lines just after the last <b>printf()</b> of
ONEINT.C to see what it does. Study it long enough to completely understand
the result. </li>
</ol>

<pre>printf(&quot;Index is %d\n it still is %d\n it is %d&quot;, </pre>

<pre>                            index, index, index);</pre>
