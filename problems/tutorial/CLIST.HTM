<p>This package contains the Introduction through Chapter 3 from the Coronado 
  Enterprises C Language Tutorial.</p>
<p>The full version tutorial teaches the entire C programming language. It is 
  composed of 13 chapters which should be studied in order since topics are introduced 
  in a logical order and build upon topics introduced in previous chapters. It 
  is to the students benefit to compile and execute each example program as it 
  is studied. The diligent student will modify the example program in some way, 
  then recompile and execute it to see if he understands the material studied 
  for that program. This will provide the student with valuable experience using 
  his compiler. </p>
<p>The recommended method of study is to print the text for one or two chapters, 
  locate the example programs in the /src directory, and study the material by 
  loading the example programs in the compiler's editor for viewing. </p>
<p>In addition, there are programming exercises at the end of most chapters which 
  you should attempt to write simply to gain the experience. An answer is given 
  for each of these exercises so you can compare your solution with another. </p>
